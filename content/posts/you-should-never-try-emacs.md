I just watched this video where [Valigo](https://www.youtube.com/@valigotech) tells that you should never try [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). He mentions how addictive Emacs is and that there is nothing like it on the market. Once you are hooked, there is no way back.

It is a funny way to advertise Emacs. Most Vim users will say something like: _"Real programmers need to learn Vim/Neovim"_ or _"You should learn Vim, it is awesome!"_ and so on. It is really funny that in this case an Emacs user is telling you not to learn Emacs.

I'm not sure if I fully agree with him in saying not to learn Emacs, but I definitely agree that learning Emacs is an awesome experience, and your perspective on how text editors for programmers should look will definitely change.

I've been hooked on it since around 2010, mostly because of the weird keybindings. Indeed, it is very hard to leave. I come and go; I did try using other editors in the past, such as the JetBrains products, Zed, Sublime, etc., and there is nothing like Emacs. The only thing I used to miss was intellisense, but now that we have LSPs, that's not a problem anymore.

So yes, don't try Emacs. You've been warned.

And by the way you can find my Emacs config here: https://github.com/dimiro1/.emacs.d
