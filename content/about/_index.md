I'm a lead engineer with 10+ years of experience, specialized in Go, currently learning Clojure. I've built diverse systems throughout my career: backends in Go, web APIs handling millions of requests per minute at [Onefootball](https://onefootball.com/), e-commerce platforms, penny auction sites in Ruby, news portals with Python/Django and PHP/WordPress, and a [GameBoy emulator in C++](https://github.com/dimiro1/GameBoyCPP/) for fun. These days I'm also building [Lunar](https://github.com/dimiro1/lunar), a serverless platform.

I thrive on learning new technologies and adapting quickly across languages and paradigms. Whether it's C, JavaScript, or the next emerging language, I focus on solving problems effectively.
